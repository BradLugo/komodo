Monitor can deploy any docker images that it can access with the configured docker accounts. It works by parsing the deployment configuration into a ```docker run``` command. The configuration is stored on MongoDB, and records of all actions (update config, deploy, stop, etc.) are stored as well.

Deployment configuration involves passing file / directory paths, for more details about passing file paths, see the [file paths doc](/file-paths).
