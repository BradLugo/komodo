# Building Images

Monitor builds docker images by cloning the source repository from Github, running `docker build`,
and pushing the resulting image to docker hub. Any repo containing a `Dockerfile` is buildable using this method.

Build configuration involves passing file / directory paths,
for more details about passing file paths, see the [file paths doc](/docs/file-paths).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
