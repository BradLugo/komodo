# monitor types

## these are the types used with the [monitor deployment system](https://github.com/mbecker20/monitor)

### these are a dependency of [monitor_client_rs](https://crates.io/crates/monitor_client_rs) crate and are reexported by that as well, so these usually don't need to be added as a standalone crate
