# Monitor ðŸ¦Ž

A tool to build and deploy software across many servers. [docs](https://mbecker20.github.io/monitor)

Docs for periphery setup script can be found in [scripts/readme.md](https://github.com/mbecker20/monitor/blob/main/scripts/readme.md).

## Changelog

### <ins>v1 (Spring 2024)</ins>

- **New resource types**:
	- **Repo**: Clone / pull configured repositories on desired Server. Run shell commands in the repo on every clone / pull to acheive automation. Listen for pushes to a particular branch to automatically pull the repo and run the command.
	- **Procedure**: Combine multiple *executions* (Deploy, RunBuild) and run them in sequence or in parallel. *RunProcedure* is an execution type, meaning procedures can run *other procedures*.
	- **Builder**: Ephemeral builder configuration has moved to being an API / UI managed entity for greater observability and ease of management.
	- **Alerter**: Define multiple alerting endpoints and manage them via the API / UI.
		- Slack support continues with the *Slack* Alerter variant.
		- Send JSON serialized alert data to any HTTP endpoint with the *Custom* Alerter variant.
	- **Template**: Define a template for your cloud provider's VM configuration, and Monitor can launch VMs based on the template.
		- Supports AWS Ec2.

- **Resource Tagging**
	- Attach multiple *tags* to resources, which can be used to group related resources together. These can be used to filter resources in the UI.
	- For example, resources can be given tags for *environment*, like `Prod`, `Uat`, or `Dev`. This can be combined with tags for the larger system the resource is a part of, such as `Authentication`, `Logging`, or `Messaging`.
	- Proper tagging will make it easy to find resources and visualize system components, even as the number of resources grows large.

- **Variables**
	- Manage global, non-secret key-value pairs using the API / UI.
	- These values can be interpolated into deployment `environments` and build `build_args`

- **Core Accounts and Secrets**
	- Docker / Github accounts and Secrets can now be configured in the Core configuration file.
	- They can still be added to the Periphery configuration as before. Accounts / Secrets defined in the Core configuration will be preferentially used over like ones defined in Periphery configuration.

- **User Groups**
	- Admins can now create User Groups and assign permissions to them as if they were a user. 
	- Multiple users can then be added to the group, and a user can be added to multiple groups.
	- Users in the group inherit the group's permissions. 

- **Monitor CLI + Sync**
	- Introduces the [monitor cli](https://crates.io/crates/monitor_cli), which can sync resources declared across multiple toml files.
	- Implements granular diffing of local and remote resources, producing detailed logs of the changes which will be made before user confirm.
	- Resource files can be checked into git and managed via PR, enabling easy scaling even with large numbers of resources.
	- All UI resources include button to export the resource to TOML for easy addition to your resource file. There is also a button to export all resources
	to make the move to file managed resources.

- **Builds**
	- Build log displays the **latest commit hash and message**.
	- In-progress builds are able to be **cancelled before completion**.
	- Specify a specific commit hash to build from.

- **Deployments**
	- Filter log lines using multiple search terms.

- **Alerting**
	- The alerting system has been redesigned with a stateful model.
	- Alerts can be in an Open or a Resolved state, and alerts are only sent on state changes.
	- For example, say a server has just crossed 80% memory usage, the configured memory threshold. An alert will be created in the Open state and the alert data will be sent out. Later, it has dropped down to 70%. The alert will be changed to the Resolved state and the alert data will again be sent.
	- In addition to server usage alerts, Monitor now supports deployment state change alerts. These are sent when a deployment's state changes without being caused by a Monitor action. For example, if a deployment goes from the Running state to the Exited state unexpectedly, say from a crash, an alert will be sent.
	- Current and past alerts can be retrieved using the API and viewed on the UI.

- **New UI**:
	- The Monitor UI has been revamped to support the new features and improve the user experience.

### <ins>v0 (Winter 2022)</ins>

- Move Core and Periphery implementation to Rust.
- Add AWS Ec2 ephemeral build instance support.
	- Configuration added to core configuration file.
- Automatic build versioning system, supporting image rollback.
- Realtime and historical system stats - CPU, memory, disk.
- Simple stats alerting based on out-of-bounds values for system stats.
	- Support sending alerts to Slack.

### <ins>Pre-versioned releases</ins>

- Defined main resource types:
	- Server
	- Deployment
	- Build
- Basics of Monitor:
	- Build docker images from Github repos.
	- Manage image deployment on connected servers, see container status, get container logs.
	- Add account credentials in Periphery configuration.
- Core and Periphery implemented in Typescript.
